# KNN_Algo-project-
🎯 Objective:
To develop a machine learning model using the KNN algorithm to accurately predict the class label of input data based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors.

📚 Key Components:
Data Loading & Preprocessing – Importing the dataset, handling missing values, normalizing features.

Model Implementation – Using KNN from scratch or libraries like scikit-learn.

Model Training – Training the KNN model with different values of K.

Model Evaluation – Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization – (Optional) Plotting decision boundaries or nearest neighbors to visualize how the model works.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
